# ESP8266 remote controller via MQTT

This program allows us to control a relay attached to an *ESP8266* (over NodeMCU board) through the MQTT protocol. With the mobile app, we can control it from anywhere.

## 1. Functionality

***MQTT*** is a machine-to-machine "Internet of Things" connectivity protocol and a extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

This application connects to a **MQTT** broker (wich you can find for free) and listens to the topic `lights` under `home` (`/home/lights`). If it receives '1' or '0' starting strings, the ESP will turn *on* or *off* a relay wich controls lights. It also publishes status info at the topic `/home/log`.

I also made a simple *Android* app for this program at this [repository](https://github.com/ismenc/android-mqtt-controller).

## 2. How to use

You will need:

:white_check_mark: To install *drivers* for your board depending on the system.

:white_check_mark: A well installed *Atom* text-editor with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) environment installed.

:white_check_mark: A cloud MQTT broker. (ok, take [this one](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/))

You will need the [knolleary](https://github.com/knolleary)'s great [:books: PubSubClient library](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) for your own projects wich is included under the *lib* directory. It can also be installed via `PlatformIO home` at *Atom*, `Libraries`.

:rocket: After that you can just clone this repository through atom or *Git* and modify and upload the main sketch. The program uses the main functions of the library but you can always check [knolleary's PubSubClient documentation](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html) for more.

Finally, in case you need in depth information about hardware or library, checkout his repo [:books: PubSubClient library](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient).
